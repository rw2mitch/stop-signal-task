# stop-signal-task
This is the stop signal task for measuring response inhibition, first developed by Lappin and Eriksen in 1966. This task is a variation of a go/no-go task, where two stimuli are each associated with a unique response. For the no-go stimulus, a "stop" signal is given just after the presentation of a go stimulus, and the participant is meant to refrain from responding.

In this case, the two go stimuli are a pink and yellow star, and the no-go stimulus (stop signal) is a "beep" sound. When running the task in lab, 
a yellow sticker should be placed on the 'd' key, and a pink one on the 'l' key.

The participant is given 1000ms to respond to a go stimulus. The delay for the stop signal is 250ms at the start of the experiment. This delay is decreased by 50ms when the participant gives a response during a nogo trial, and increased by 50ms when the participant does not respond.

This program was made using the jsPsych library. It's a great framework for anyone with limited programming knowledge that wants to code a psychology study while also learning about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can look into it more at <a href="www.jspsych.org">www.jspsych.org</a>.

This was the first JavaScript program I had ever written, and I wrote it without any prior knowledge in JavaScript or HTML. This is where I first learned about JavaScript syntax, objects, variables, and functions.
